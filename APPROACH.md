# Approach

## It's enough to use this module (and docs)

One should not need to turn to the plain `raygun4js` docs, in order to use any of the features exposed - nor even be aware of its existence.

This is because people have enough libraries to deal with. Needing to compare two generations of APIs would be wasted time. Raygun customers would rather use the time to learn Raygun itself (the online tool).
