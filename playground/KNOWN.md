## ðŸ¦žðŸ¦žðŸ¦ž Mdsvex syntax highlighting (in WebStorm)

This is a major turnoff for WebStorm / mdsvex use at the moment (Dec 2021).

[Mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com) allows writing web apps using Markdown and *I'm definitely not going away from it*. It simplifies text intensive things like the Playground.

The problem is that there's currently absolutely no highlighting for the `.svelte.md` files (or whatever you want to call them); this is more important because this kinds of files bundle in so many formats. `.svelte` has CSS, JavaScript and HTML. A `.svelte.md` syntax highlighter should be capable of handling Markdown as well (and Svelte-like espaces from it, as shown by the below example):

There is a [MDX plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx).

*tbd. Ticket to suggest and follow this...*

*Note: Official postfix for mdsvex is `.svx`.*
