# Send errors to Raygun

There are two ways to ship errors to the Raygun dashboard: explicitly and by catching errors that leaked through.
Let's exercise these and see that the errors get reported in the Raygun dashboard.

## Explicit

<div>
  <label for="msg1">Nag:</label>
  <input type="text" id="msg1" placeholder="error message here.." />
  <button onclick="rgSend( getElementById('msg1').value )">Send</button>
</div>

## Safe-guarded


## Follow-up

- Open the [Raygun dashboard](https://app.raygun.com)
- ..under the project you gave `RAYGUN_API_KEY` for
- > `Crash Reporting`

Can you see the errors provided above?

Next: [offline](/offline)

<script>
  //import { send } from '@local/package'
  function rgSend(msg) {
    //send(msg);
    alert(22);
  }

  export { rgSend }
</script>
